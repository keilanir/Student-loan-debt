# Student Loan Debt Calculator

---

This project is an interactive jQuery calculator meant to show the effects of student loan debt on the starting salaries of recent college graduates.
I made this project for the UF College of Journalism and Communication's Advanced Online Production class taught by [Mindy McAdams](http://github.com/macloo).
I created this project from start to finish -- the concept, code and design are all mine and made from scratch over the course of three weeks.
